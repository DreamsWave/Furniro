This project is a website I built using React, TypeScript, and various other tools. I created it for practice and to learn technologies such as Tailwind CSS, Shadcn, React Hook Form, and Zod.

I obtained the website design from the available [eCommerce Website design](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1252561852327562039/ecommerce-website-web-page-design-ui-kit-interior-landing-page) in Figma.
